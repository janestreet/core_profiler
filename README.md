Core_profiler
=============

Core_profiler is a library that helps you profile programs and
estimate various costs. The library comes in three different flavors:

- `disabled` which does nothing, so that one can leave probes in a
  program without performance penalty
- `online` to print live stats
- `offline` to store data on disk for later analysis
